## Live-Speech-Analyzer-Expert.AI ##

### Inspiration
I am working indigenously with Voice and Speech. I thought of implementing a live analysis of how we speak in a meeting, online. As the world is sitting badly at pandemic the only way we connect is online so the way we communicate is important. Hence, thought of a solution that helps to analyze the way you speak.
###  What it does
Our application checks on the way you speak in front of the computer and provide live analysis on the way we speak using expert.ai cloud api.
### What are the things it uses from Expert.AI
It uses
## NATURAL LANGUAGE API 
## Behaviour traits 
## Sentimental analysis(analyze)  
## Disambguity
## FullSentiment(Sentiment score also obtained)
## PII
## Writeprint
## Relations

### How it works
The Reactjs app uses web sppech to detect the speech as soon as we hit start button we can speak at Microphone using Speech to Text it converts the words we
utter into the phrases we obtain.
As soon we take a pause automatically speech recognition stops
Now we can analyse the phrase applying the expert.ai API with the buttons available.
To start speaking again we click on start button again and receive that microphone has started with on option.Currently Web Speech API supports different browsers.
## Usefulness
Understanding the way we speak
Useful in analysing the way we have communicated
The way we presented ourselves in Google meet
Very useful for Customer Call Center support to analyse the sentiments.
